-= Triangle of Success =-

1. KUGU/QUGU => Stands for King Under God or the Universe OR Queen Under God or the Universe. It is the concept that we are not as big as we think we are, we are always accountable to the greater power out there that runs all things and also will never have all the answers nor always be in full control. The belief that we are guided by this great power and that there is always something out there watching over us and that there is a reason and a purpose for every challenge/setback or pain in life, both good and bad pains. We may never understand these challenges in the moment, but in the future when looking back we hope that these situations help us to become better human beings.

2. Lives Touched, Lives Changed => The reason why we are here in this world is to touch lives and change lives. Every person of this philosophy understands this. The big questions to ask are => “Why did I come to this world?” and “What will I leave behind when I’m gone?” At every moment we must live to touch lives and change lives for the betterment of humanity.

3. Clockwork => Everything we create or do or make or the services and products we provide should revolve around this notion of clockwork.  Understand the common things that happen regularly for human beings on a day to day, week to week, month to month, year to year, decade to decade basis. By understanding these clockwork items you can better address the needs of people and create products and services and items to address those needs. Make what people need and want, not things that they would not have a use for unless you can show them that use. For example, a mobile phone would not do much good in the time of Christopher Columbus unless there were others who also had mobile phones. To him it would have been as good as a fancy rock or paper weight. Later as phone technology expanded and grew it became more of a requirement to have a mobile phone. Thus a need was created and from that need stemmed other sub-needs (Phone Cases, Headsets, Stylus Pens, etc.)

4. M5i => M stands for Magical, make everything you create or provide feel magical to the people who are using it. 5 stands for the five stratospheric laws of success from the Red Book the “Go Giver” by Bob Burg.  

The Law of Value: Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.

The Law of Compensation: Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.

The Law of Influence: Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people’s interests first. 

The Law of Authenticity: The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself

The Law of Receptivity: The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.

Finally the i in M5i stands for Indispensable. To all you help and those you serve, be indispensable. Your value will increase a hundredfold if a replacement for you is hard to find or near impossible.

5. PGVMRH => Your daily wake up ritual which you will do every morning when you wake up. We all will go off track but keeping a system in place for every morning will give you an opportunity to get back on track again. This morning ritual should take you about 15 minutes the moment you wake up. Start by closing your eyes and begin in the following order:

P - Prayer => Have a moment of focused prayer or meditation. This is an opportunity for you to connect with God or the source of the Universe whatever that may be for you.

G - Gratitude => Pick three new things from the day before that you can be grateful for. Try and pick new things every day.

V - Visualization => Visualize your day for success. See your day as successful. See every interaction that’s important and see it as the positive outcome you want it to be. Focus ONLY on the positive outcomes only!

M - Motivation => Watch or listen to something motivational. This should be something that gets you pumped up and makes you want to attack the day with the greatest strength and vigour possible!

R - Reading => Read from a book. Make it a habit to complete about 4-5 books per year or more if possible.

H - Health => Do something healthy, whether it is working out at a gym or some morning yoga. Eat healthy, exercise and optimize and maintain your machine, your body and mind.

Use the triangle of success to guide your path.

-= Calendar of Success =-

You will now build a calendar using a grid sheet of paper. Each grid box will represent a single day in a 3 year period. You are to create a few sheets of about 15 by 73 which is equivalent to 1,095 days or 3 years. Feel free to adjust slightly should you have a leap year.

Starting on the upcoming monday, you are to start working immediately only on getting real results and results only. Should you ever feel the need to complain or worry about your life, hold your tongue and do not do so until the 3 year period is over and you see your results from the 3 year period. You’ll soon learn that negativity, self loathing, complaints and worry are all useless items and are best left to those who choose to live a life of destitution and suffering.

Take action now, put down this book and draw out your grid system.

For every day that goes by that you are following the system of complete focus on real results only, draw a red checkmark. You must make it a point to not let a single day pass without getting a red checkmark for a total of 2 of the 3 years or at least 700 boxes to be exact.

Upon completion, I recommend you review your results and restart this process again and again until you have read this book several times over the course of a decade or two and obtained incredible results in the areas you desire.

At the end of each day simply answer the following question:
Did I focus on achieving and obtaining real results today? If Yes, then red checkmark, If No, then leave the box empty.

That’s it for this daily exercise. Now move onto the actual tools you’ll need to pull off the real results in your life.

-= Refuse the Negative Mind =-

There exists in each of us a negative mindset always looking at trying to tell us not to do something or to make us believe we could never do something. Sometimes it is right, other times it is dead wrong. The base goal is to try and avoid pain and go after pleasure. However many times most things worth having in life require a considerable amount of pain and hard work. 

Life itself happens from great pain. Mothers go through great pain just to give birth to produce life and that too after nine months. Anything worth having in life is worth doing hard work for and many times requires us to do things that we find to be scary or outside of our comfort zone.

The majority of people allow this negative mindset to take hold and keep us from the very things that we truly deserve.  It could be a promotion at a job, a business thats got your name on it, the love of your life, the money and power levels in life that you know you are worthy of. The thing that keeps most people back is the negative mindset.

There is a saying that I once heard that apparently comes from the Japanese Samurai. Any decision worth making, do it within three heartbeats or do not do it at all. The moment you take too much time to decide to do the things you know are right for you, your conscious mind will come to talk you out of it. At times this is useful however most of the time it is not and is simply the negative mind trying to keep you from your dreams and goals. 

Waking up in the morning, taking that risk which could get you a promotion, choosing to skip bad foods that could cause you disease and choosing good food instead and many other decisions that we know we should immediately take action on can be helped with this one technique of taking action for the right things.

Watch for the negative mind in your life. Hard work and preparation as well as visualization will help keep this mindset at bay. This is why preparation and hard work is the key!

-= Monthly Brain Dump Exercise =-

Once a month make it a habit to take a blank sheet of paper and write down whatever comes to mind. This could be meetings, goals, ideas, concerns or any other matter of thing that comes to your head.

This one exercise will relieve your stress by you writing things down and removing them from your brain. Make sure you do not force anything at all and simply start with a blank sheet and write everything down for a solid thirty minutes to one hour.

Feel free to go down any idea for as deep as you wish until returning back to write another item down that is in your mind.

Once completed you can go over the most important things and take action on them. Prioritize any other items and focus on those items that, if done, would deliver the maximum results.

You’ll be surprised to see how much more results you produce just by doing this. Set a day and time to do this exercise now!

-= Meals =-

Your body is not so much what you eat only, but also HOW you eat it. Make it a habit to eat between 3-6 meals a day, smaller meals if possible and do not eat 3-4 hours before you rest.

Eat meals in the following way with a focus of approximately 2,000 calories in general and you will see a difference in weight and your life:
Eat your breakfast like a royal! Place the maximum of your 2,000 calories here. The larger your first meal is the longer you have in the day to digest it all.
Eat your lunches and in between meals in smaller portions. These should be light and should NEVER make you fall asleep afterwards
Eat your last meal like a person who can barely find any food to eat. Keep these meals small and simple. You should not have meals that will put you to sleep.

What we have effectively done here is flipped the traditional meal eating around and made breakfast your biggest meal and dinner your smallest meal. This will give your body enough time to digest and process your food and nutrients and vitamins and thus make it easier to lose weight.

Finally drink lots of water, 6-8 glasses. This is a MUST!

Brian Tracy puts it this way, “Eat breakfast like a King, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper!”

Put Brian Tracey’s books (2), “Eat That Frog” and “Million Dollar Habits” as two of the books on your yearly reading list.

-= Business Automation =-

Read Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and also his second book on Quadrants. Understand that you want to reach the B and I quadrants. First you need to focus on the B quadrant.

This is business automation and you should make it your complete focus to invest and build automated businesses.

Here is how you know you are working on an automated business => If you can leave your business and go on vacation for an entire year and come back to more money from your business, chances are your business is automated.  If however you leave and your business would shut down (You are the business), you OWN a job.

Employees have a job, Small Business Owners OWN a job. Business Owners and Investors own systems and let their money make more money.  Focus on this and put his books (2), “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” and “Cashflow Quadrant” as two of the next books on your yearly reading list.

-= Dress For Success =-

Always dress for the part you want in life. If you plan to be a financially successful person, dress in suits and business attire. If you think you’ll be financially wealthy and dress like a vagrant on the streets you’re falling into the trap of the “unicorns”. Do not focus on myths and legends. Focus on real steps you can take to get real results. The fastest way to the top aside from who you know is how you dress. Like it or not your visual appearance will either get you the position where you command people or where others can easily command you.

I didn’t make these laws and rules, I simply use them. Just like I didn’t create gravity but we have it with us every day. The principle in this one is when you dress for success, success will come. PERIOD. You are judged every day even if you think you’re not supposed to be. Dress the part and the world will move to your chorus. Give it a try today, for the next 30 days dress like you are the CEO of a major corporation EVERYWHERE YOU GO! Watch and see how people treat you with more respect, more authority and much more. -= Nayra =-

-= Workout More Than 3 Times A Week =-

3-5 Times a week you should be doing extensive bodybuilding. A healthy body will match a healthy mind. People associate success with those who are healthy. Your habits MUST include 3-5 times a week of physical body building and gym.

Here is the workout program I recommend you stick to:

-(Workout 1) Chest
-(Workout 2) Biceps
-(Workout 3) Back
-(Workout 4) Triceps
-(Workout 5) Legs and Abs
-(Workout 6) Cardio
-REPEAT THE ABOVE

You can either do all six exercises in a week or in a two week system. Start off with a two week system until you get results. Then increase to 4 or 5 workouts per week. You MUST change your mindset to make bodybuilding and this healthy habit a PART OF YOUR IDENTITY!  Healthy is WHO you are, not just something you do.  When you think like this, you will see the results.

-= Monday Morning Reset =-

We all don’t always get it right. Always forgive yourself and restart EVERY week on Monday. Clean slate every monday to start over and do it right again the next week. This one tip has kept me going consistently even when I make mistakes. Persistence is one of the key habits to success and this one habit of the Monday Morning Resets has helped me to keep going even when I thought I couldn’t. Use it today and see your life change forever! -= Naherh =-

-= Results vs ByProducts =-

Six pack abs, millionaire and financially wealthy, the perfect life, the perfect partner, the perfect house, the perfect job, incredible health, etc. These are examples of what people call RESULTS, however I call them something else...a BY-PRODUCT. A By-product is something that happens as a result of doing something else. The trouble with society and most people however is they see the results or By-Products and simply think that’s what success is and simply want the final result or by-product. A By-Product comes from someone’s consistent habits and lifestyle and identity they have chosen. For example, my IDENTITY is health and thus I don’t think of the gym as simply a chore. It is who I am and I go to the gym regularly. The muscles and incredible health that I have developed are simply a BY-PRODUCT of me going to the gym, they are NOT the reason I go to the gym. The same thing applies to the financial success I have. I am financially wealthy because my identity is financial abundance and so I literally dress like a wealthy person, I think like a wealthy person by investing my money and taking risks and running businesses and building business systems and automation and investing in stocks, etc. The financial success is simply a BY-PRODUCT of me living with those habits. Whatever results you wish for in life, I want you to do this exercise now and write out WHAT items you would have to do on a daily basis for that result or by-product to happen. For example if you wanted to find the perfect lover, think about the person you would have to be for them and what they would need and start to live that way.  Soon as your habits start to reflect that, you’ll find that you are connecting with more people who seem to match your By-Product or result. Don’t be surprised if you do find the perfect lover after doing this exercise. Go ahead now and write out all the habits and things you would have to be and do in order to have the desired By-Product. I usually put my desired result or by-product in a circle on an empty sheet of paper and then I write out all the items required around this circle, especially habits I have to have and the identity I have to have.  Once you have written it all out, make it a point to start developing these habits and identities in you and you should start to see the by-products of your habits start to materialize.

-= Systems and Automation =-
Use the following methodology to automate and optimize your work. Setup a Kanban system and use an Agile/Scrum methodology using 2 week sprints. Here is how it works => First use a whiteboard or even an online digital software (In this time in history there is a software known as Trello that allows us to do this but you can easily do this on a sheet of paper as well). Create several lists as follows from left to right => Backlog/Features/Issues/Ideas (This is ONE LIST), Sprint Planning, Sprint Items, In Progress, Done. Now with these 5 lists you will begin by choosing what project you are working on for this SPRINT/KANBAN BOARD and you will start listing out all the ideas, features and issues in the first list. Then from there you will take items you believe you can handle in about 2 weeks. Move those items into the Sprint Planning list. Now you will choose items from the sprint planning list that you will FOR SURE dedicate your time to for the next two weeks and place those in the SPRINT list. Once you are ready you will begin doing work on those items. Any item you are currently working on from the sprint list you will place in the IN PROGRESS list. Only put things that you are actively working on in that list. Once done simply move them to the done pile. At the end of two weeks, review your progress, see if there are any areas you can optimize/automate or delegate to someone else the next time and repeat the sprint process again from the beginning. Using this system you will be able to automate your projects in life and get real results faster and more efficiently the more often you do it.

-= 60 Days Per New Habit =-

Create ONLY good habits that help you to grow and benefit you to become even more successful! Remove any bad habits by recognizing the trigger and then doing something else (a different process) to achieve the same reward or better. Any new habits you want to build, take approximately 60 days to solidify. Also keep in mind the opposite is true, thus it is of utmost importance to make the habits you want by focusing on 60 days to build them. Once built keep on working at them just like a muscle. When you stop using a muscle it withers and dies away. So too do habits! Make sure to always continue to work on your habit over and over until it’s part of your identity. New habits take 60 days to get up and running correctly so make it a point to get these new habits created and STICK TO THEM! Most importantly, people will start saying things to deter you. Do not listen to this fodder and noise. Keep to your plan and ignore the critics. They wish they could become better, they are afraid to take the steps that you are already doing. KEEP FOCUSED!

-= Read At Least 5 Books Per Year =-

Make it a habit to read five (5) books per year which are non-fiction. These books should teach you new skills or help you to upgrade your current skills. To read faster, read books with the audiobook version playing in the background. As you take in this new found information, every year you will gain more strength and knowledge which you can then apply to your life and grow. Your goal is to APPLY the knowledge from books, not just to be a memorizer of words. It is better to have read one sentence from a book and take swift real action that delivers results than to have read an entire book and never take even a single action in your life. You are not to be a google search engine, you are to be a person of action. That is the difference between those who are successful and those who fail. Successful people will take action with whatever resources they have. People, even with all the information, who take no action at all, will end up failing. This is why you will find many people in life who are very studious and good at getting high marks usually employed by those who had less information and knowledge YET TOOK ACTION! Do not simply regurgitate information, APPLY IT and SUCCEED!

-= The Underdog Is A Lucky Fool =-

Lucky is the fool who bets all they have in the 1-in-a-million shot. If all you do is simply live for this then you’ll live a very sad life indeed. Instead be a steady hand focused on guaranteed wins to begin with so that you can gain a solid standing. ONCE you have a solid footing in life, THEN use 10% of your strength (Be it money, power, fame, fortune or other success) on a fools attempt for at that time it wouldn’t feel as foolish and even if it doesn’t work out you would at least have enough to continue forward and try again.  And does it not work in your favor to be able to try again and again until you hit success? Thus understand it is better to first focus on NEAR GUARANTEED RESULTS with higher probabilities FIRST before focusing on underdog events to help you succeed. Stay clear of Underdogs or they will woo you with their tall tales of potential power and glory. Focus first on wise counsel with people who have real results and only look to these awe inspiring stories AFTER you have a solid footing from realistic higher probability resulting events. REAL RESULTS, REAL SUCCESS FIRST!

-= Number Tracking With Underline =-

One technique I recommend is to choose a number you wish to track and write it somewhere on a board or paper and hang it on a wall where you can see it. For example if money is the target number, write down the number and start using underlines with a marker or colored pencil to underline the numbers you have completed.

For example let’s say your financial goal number is this: $9,737,623.26 CAD. You would underline, in GREEN colored marker, the items you have hit. It will look something like the following:

$9 , 7 3 7 , 6 2 3 . 2 6 CAD
       2 -   - - -   - -

Underneath the other numbers that are not completed I put the number that I’m already at. In the above example if I was at $28,000 CAD I would write the number 2 (two) underneath the third digit (the 3). I would then update it to an underline afterwards when I achieved over the amount of $37,623.26 CAD even by one penny. At that point I would put a 0 under the 7 and a green line under the 3.

Track in this way and look at it daily and you’ll be surprised to see how fast you achieve your goal.

-= Track your INCOME/EXPENSES DAILY! What gets measured, GROWS! =-

Do this next exercise and don’t ever stop. You will be amazed at how much you start to grow financially. From your financial success you can then take that success into other areas. Remember this saying always => WHAT GETS MEASURED...GROWS! You can create a simple spreadsheet that tracks your income (Money In) and your expenses (Money Out) and the final net total in the day (Money In - Money Out = Net Total In The Day). After one month you’ll see some results, after six months most definitely you will see results, and after years of doing this you should see a much better financial future. Make sure to adjust course after viewing this information. Reduce unnecessary costs and expenses. Pay down and clear credit cards and loans that are carrying bad debts, namely debts that are not generating money for you. Get rid of those items that cause you to lose money and instead replace them with ASSETS that produce monthly recurring income. You will be amazed at how easy this really is, but the first several times you do this (just like any other habit) it will be difficult to do. Add assets, remove liabilities!

-= Use a bullet journal and do a daily check up on tasks to be done =-

Bullet journals are an incredible tool that I highly recommend. If you have not heard of it, go and read The Bullet Journal by Ryder Carroll. Plainly put a bullet journal is a set of pages that are custom built by you written down on paper with your own handwriting. The process of writing something down by hand does an incredible thing inside the mind. It allows you to plan out better and to top it off you’ll not have to worry about being confused by overly complex technology. It’s simple, easy to do and easy to make mistakes with. The trouble in our digital and technological society is that we’ve become accustomed to pretty looking things. The mind actually works in the opposite fashion and thrives in complexities that are simple. Though that may sound like an oxymoron, to work on complex ideas and thoughts, a simple pencil or pen and paper will do. Use it to build your schedule, your calendar or anything else for that matter without worrying about mistakes. If you wish to do it digitally I still recommend using a tablet or other technology that allows you to still write things down on digital paper. Every brain is different and every person unique, so too should your planning and calendaring systems be as well. Use your bullet journal in conjunction with technology and you’ll be even more ahead. Go and research bullet journaling today and do use it daily to check up on the tasks that need to be done.

-= Learn a new language FLUENTLY so you can speak at least 2 or more languages in your life =-

You MUST be able to speak more than one language in your life. Learn two or more languages to a fluency level so that you can speak it as if you were a native speaker of that language. Not only will it help you in learning more about the world you live in, it will also give you strengths in human connectivity like you have never experienced before. Take this to heart and start immediately. -= Naveen =-

-= Focus on REVENUES and Profits first, everything else works out after =-

You must focus on revenues and profits first. Focus on the methods and actions that generate revenues namely marketing and sales. Everything else works only AFTER the revenues come in, not before! You must develop systems and methods that are built around sales and marketing and other areas that generate revenues. If it does NOT generate revenues, get rid of it. Only dabble in secondary or tertiary items AFTER revenues have been produced at a profit level that can easily sustain such secondary or tertiary items easily. The only expenses you should have to start with should be MONEY MAKING EXPENSES ONLY!

-= Build up 5 or more streams of revenue =-

In your life you should always have a minimum of five (5) or more streams of consistent revenue. When resources flow easily into your system, it’s easy to live and direct your life and build the freedom you want on your terms. If you do not earn resources in this way, you will simply be a beggar holding a pot awaiting your next meal with wishful eyes. Focus your attention and all your energies daily on creating these five or more streams so that they cover all your basic expenses easily. Then after that keep optimizing and replacing these streams with better streams of revenue until you have an optimal set of streams that no longer require you to work but simply focus on building the incredible life you so desire. -= Ooboob =-

-= Lazy is a word used for the dead, do not be amongst these zombies =-

Even if you have all the money in the world and all the success, do not be as the zombies and walk around being Lazy. Find other areas you can contribute your skills and gifts in and touch lives and change lives around the universe. Hard work along with smart work always works. Lazy people remain poor and foolish. They will walk around like zombies awaiting the day when “success” finally lands on their lap and all they have to do is complain to as many people as possible. When one walks around aimlessly, or like a zombie, stay clear, wish them well and on their way but do not dilly dally in their business lest they try and make you a zombie as well! Their disease is the way of the Lazy and the only cure is not some magic potion or get success fast scheme, it is hard work and persistence, even if it takes 1 year, 5 years, 10 years or a whole lifetime. -= Ifif =-

-= Success is the result of getting up after every failure =-

Success is the result of getting up after every failure and one of those times is success. This is why there is NO SUCH SUCCESS without failure or falling. It is literally a PART of being successful! In order to succeed you must fail an incredible amount of times and make sure to rise that last time when it is a success. Should you fall again, change something and try again. Do not repeat the same mistakes but get back up after every attempt until you have success. That is the only way to succeed truly.

-= Less is More =-

If you have one good one, you don’t need 10. If you have 10, reduce as needed or replace as needed. This applies to OBJECTS and RELATIONSHIPS. What this means is that if you have a good calculator, you do not need five. If however you have five then take good care of them but get no more unless absolutely needed. Many times we hoard things due to fears that we may never get them again. If two calculators do different things then that is not the same. But if you have the exact same calculator and the other four are not being used, this is more than is needed.

When you need something, believe that you will find it or it will come to you. Preparation is one thing, hoarding things and keeping them uselessly is another. Balance is the key.

If you have one good relationship you do not need 1,000. One beautiful high quality relationship is worth much more than a plentiful amount of subpar relationships. At the same time work with the current relationships you have and try to get them to a higher status. Remember you cannot change others, only yourself. You can persuade, justify, try as hard as you can, but unless someone is willing to change, it’s not going to happen. Let that relationship go and come back to it at a future date if it is worthy of repair. For example worthy relationships could be parents, spouses, children, siblings, etc. Unworthy friends are not worth keeping at any cost. Great friendships are worth keeping and blossoming.

Stay clear of those who do not share your visions and goals or who are not a part of your harmonious chorus. Every relationship gauge if you become a better person after meeting with them or worse. If 9 out of 10 times it is worse then move away from such an individual or group of people or objects.

With objects, reduce what is not being used and make sure every object and relationship has a home. If you do not make time for a relationship you will not have it. If you do not make time and/or place for an object, it will simply be a useless object treated as junk and soon will be removed from your life.

Another idea is something known as death cleaning. It is the concept of removing things that your family would fight over or would cause trouble over when you die. If you believe an object could be a cause of stress for your family or friends, remove it while you are living.  The countless amounts of fights and hardships over a useless knick knack that has potential sentimental value has driven families and siblings apart for many a generation. Deal with these things while you are alive. Give away or remove useless knick knacks that could cause unnecessary hardship to your next generations or others after you pass away.

As you reduce you’ll also feel like a weight has been lifted and you will generally feel lighter. Less truly is more! -= efilfosevol =-

-= Your Destination is a Lifestyle, Not A Goal or A Place But A Way Of Life =-

Before leaving you, I wish to impart one very important concept that has helped me and I hope it helps you. It was given by Tony Robbins and that it that WHO we become when we are going after our destination is more important than the destination itself.

So many people go through life looking to achieve a goal or get to a certain place. Rather I urge you to look at a LIFESTYLE as the destination. Living life in such a way as to be fulfilled and your very best version of you that you can be, that should be your ultimate destination, a way of living life.

Make an exercise to write out your current lifestyle right now, and then write out the perfect lifestyle. Do your Daily, Weekly, Quarterly and Yearly lifestyle and then compare the two. Simply move towards your targeted lifestyle as your ultimate destination.

Who you are while living that Lifestyle should be what you seek. When you target this instead and eventually get it, you’ll experience a life that fulfills you and will make you want to jump out of bed and thank God you’re alive to experience it all.

Build memories, build beautiful experiences, build relationships...build LIFESTYLES my friend...I hope to see you doing your greatest so that if the entire universe and heaven itself came to see you, God or the Universe would say, ‘You see that! That’s the very best version of them, a true representation of my greatest creations...this is what a human being is...a living, walking reflection of me...a god walking the UNIVERSE!’

BE A BLESSING! BE A HOPE! BE A JOY! YOU ARE A MIND WITH A BODY AND A HEART WITH A SOUL!

-= Finally, Don’t Ever Give Up! =-

Speak these words out loud before you leave this book: 
“My destination is a state of living and being, a lifestyle. It is not an achievement or some absolute final item but an always flowing way of living at my very best to consistently produce the greatest of fruit possible at the best of my abilities at that given space and time and build the most magical memories and relationships and thus my way of life. For me to be able to make lives better including my own. The highest quality lifestyle fit for ROYALTY...fit for a god!”

My final words here to you are Don’t Ever Give Up!
